STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
**Step 1: Make the Blueberry-Maple Syrup**
Combine the maple syrup, lemon juice and 2/3 of the blueberries in a small saucepan.
Bring to a boil.
Gently boil the mixture for about ten minutes, then set aside to cool a bit. When the syrup is lukewarm, stir in the remaining blueberries.

**Step 2: Make the Pancakes**
Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl.
Whisk to combine.
In another bowl, beat the eggs.
Add the buttermilk and melted butter.
Whisk to combine.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and whisk until just combined. The batter will be thick and a bit lumpy.
Using a *1/3 cup measure*, drop the batter onto an oiled nonstick pan or griddle.
Top each pancake with blueberries.
When the first side is golden brown, flip the pancakes and cook for about 30 seconds more. You can see that they get quite tall and deliciously crispy on the surface.
Stack the pancakes and spoon the blueberry maple syrup over top.
